# Random seed list for multiple runs with different random initializations
# Each seed controls:
# 1. Dirichlet sampling in simulate_clean_data() - biological variability between samples
# 2. Batch assignment in stratified_batches_from_columns() - which samples go to which batch
# 3. Noise generation in apply_batch_effect() - random variance added by batch effects
# 4. Add noise to zero-variance glycans in simulate_clean_data()
# Note: Batch direction vectors (u_dict) are generated ONCE using ALL seeds together,
#       ensuring consistent batch structure across all runs for fair comparison.
