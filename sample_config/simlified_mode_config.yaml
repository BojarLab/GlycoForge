# Batch Factor Parameters
n_batches: 3
affected_fraction: [0.1, 0.5]  # Fraction range of affected glycans per batch
positive_prob: 0.6             # Probability of positive effects
overlap_prob: 0.5              # Probability of overlap between batches

# Batch Effect Strength (Support Grid Search: list or single value)
kappa_mu: [0.5, 1.0 , 1.5, 2.0]  # Mean shift strength control per batch = kappa_mu * sigma * u_b
var_b: [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]          # Variance ratio per batch = var_b * baseline_variance


# Random seed list for multiple runs with different random initializations
# Each seed controls:
# 1. Dirichlet sampling in simulate_clean_data() - biological variability between samples
# 2. Batch assignment in stratified_batches_from_columns() - which samples go to which batch
# 3. Noise generation in apply_batch_effect() - random variance added by batch effects
# 4. Add noise to zero-variance glycans in simulate_clean_data()
# Note: Batch direction vectors (u_dict) are generated ONCE using ALL seeds together,
#       ensuring consistent batch structure across all runs for fair comparison.
