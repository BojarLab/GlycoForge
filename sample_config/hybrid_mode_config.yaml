# Random seed list for multiple runs with different random initializations
# Each seed controls:
# 1. Dirichlet sampling in simulate_clean_data() - biological variability between samples
# 2. Batch assignment in stratified_batches_from_columns() - which samples go to which batch
# 3. Noise generation in apply_batch_effect() - random variance added by batch effects
# 4. Add noise to zero-variance glycans in simulate_clean_data()
# Note: Batch direction vectors (u_dict) are generated ONCE using ALL seeds together,
#       ensuring consistent batch structure across all runs for fair comparison.

# Biological Signal Configuration
n_H: 50
n_U: 50

# Differential Mask Options:
# - "Null": No biological signal injected (all zeros). Useful for negative control.
# - "All": Inject signal into all glycans (all ones).
# - "significant": Use significant glycans marked by glycowork.motif.analysis.get_differential_expression 
#   (using sample-size-adjusted alpha and FDR-corrected p-values via Benjamini-Hochberg or adaptive grouped methods).
# - "Top-N": Use the top N glycans with the largest Cohen's d effect sizes (e.g., "Top-10") from glycowork.motif.analysis.get_differential_expression analysis.

# Bio Factor Parameters (Support Grid Search: list or single value)

# Robust Bio Factor Processing (Advanced: rarely need to change)
# Note: Winsorization is ALWAYS enabled (hardcoded) to handle extreme outliers robustly.
